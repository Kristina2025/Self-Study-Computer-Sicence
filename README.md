# Self-Study-Computer-Sicence

I've decided to teach myself computer science, starting from the basics and working my way up. At the end of this journey, I hope to give myself a full CS education. I'll use free online University courses from MIT, UC Berkeley, Standford, Harward, Princeton...

Currently working on: Algebra and Geometry + CS61A - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
